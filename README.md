### Description
Such as the name suggests this app will generate a new quote everytime a user waits 10 - 20 seconds or when the user clicks on the 'Show another quote' button. When this button is clicked the background color also changes to a random color. Should I have the background color change when the quote automatically changes too 🤔

### Install

```
  nothing to install for this project 😄
